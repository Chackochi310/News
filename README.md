# News
A simple news project that fetches news contents from backend and rendered on frontend using React and Tailwind

 # Overview 
This project is a news application that fetches articles from the GNews API and displays them to users. It consists of a frontend built with React hosted on Firebase and a backend powered by Express hosted on Render


 # Project Setup Instructions

  # Prerequisites
    Node.js installed
    Firebase account
    GNews API key
    Backend Setup
    Navigate to the backend folder.

# Install dependencies:

  npm install


# Approach
The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to fetch news articles.
The backend fetches data from the GNews API and serves it to the frontend.
Implemented search and pagination functionalities to enhance user experience.

# Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I faced was hosting the frontend on Firebase, as this was my first time using the platform for deployment. I encountered issues with configuring the hosting settings and ensuring that the application built correctly. To overcome these challenges, I referred to the Firebase documentations, which helped clarify the process. Additionally, I decided to host the backend on Render, which allowed me to keep working while learning Firebase deployment.
